# Introduction

Pumpkins is a GraphQL API framework. It takes a code-first approach (as opposed
to schema-first) and brings together a set of tools that provide robust type
safety so that if your app compiles, you have a much higher degree of confidence
than with vanilla JavaScript or just TypeScript.

Pumpkins brings Nexus, Prisma, Apollo Server and more together into a pluggable
system (in fact Prisma features are implemented as a plugin).

### Getting Started

```
yarn init -y
yarn add pumpkins
```

```ts
// schema.ts

import { objectType, queryType } from 'pumpkins'

export const ObjectType = objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.id('id')
    t.string('name')
  },
})

export const QueryType = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.list.field('users', {
      type: 'User',
      resolve() {
        return [{ id: '1643', name: 'newton' }]
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```ts
// app.ts

import { createApp } from 'pumpkins'
import * as types from './schema'

createApp({ types }).server.start()
```

```
$ pumpkins dev
```

In the above, the `resolve` func of `users` field is strongly typed and
guarantees that the shape of data returned conforms to the schema definition of
`User`. There is literally zero effort for you to get this working. Just enter dev mode
and start working on your app.

`pumpkins dev` uses flexible conventions to find your app without config needed
from you.

Once you're ready to deploy to production, you just run a build step (and again,
flexible conventions enable pumpkins to find your entrypoint):

```
$ pumpkins build
```

### Removing boilerplate

`pumpkins` ships a global app singleton that helps us remove boilerplate, code that
is repetitive, predictable, and not of essential value to writing or reading the
source code.

```diff
- import { objectType, queryType } from 'pumpkins'

- export const ObjectType = objectType({
+ objectType({
    name: 'User',
    definition(t) {
      t.id('id)
      t.string('name')
    },
  })

- export const QueryType = queryType({
+ queryType({
    definition(t) {
      t.list.field('users', {
        type: 'User',
        resolve() {
          return [{ id: '1643', name: 'newton' }]
        },
      })
    },
  })
```

```diff
- import { createApp } from 'pumpkins'
- import * as types from './schema'

- createApp({ types }).server.start()
+ app({ types }).server.start()
```

If the app global singleton is not meeting your requirements or tastes, not only
can you ignore it but you can turn it off in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pumpkins": {
    "singleton": false
  }
}
```

Which literally affects the runtime and global static types of your project.

### Removing even more boilerplate

We just saw how the API helps us stay focused. But we can go further. `pumpkins` believes developers should adopt complexity gradually. In the above example, a simple app, `app.ts` isn't doing much for us. Well, we can just remove it. And when we go to dev or build our app, `pumpkins` provides us with a default.

```diff
  |- schema.ts
- |- app.ts
```

This is just a teaser. There are more features like this. The point to take in now is the `pumpkins` philosophy of optional complexity.

### Adding Prisma Framework

Prisma Framework is a next-generation developer-centric tool chain focused on making the data layer easy. `pumpkins` makes it incredibly easy to get it integrated into your app.

```diff
  |- schema.ts
+ |- schema.prisma
```

```groovy
// schema.prisma

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:dev.db"
}

generator photon {
  provider = "photonjs"
}

model User {
  id   Int    @id
  name String
}
```

```diff
  objectType({
    name: 'User',
    definition(t) {
-     t.id('id)
-     t.string('name')
+     t.model.id()
+     t.model.name()
    },
  })
```

We've also changed something about our schema. `User` `id` field has gone from a `ID` type to `Int`. `pumpkins` helps us here, as we'll see a static error in the `resolve` func of `users` query field now. So lets change that:

```diff
  queryType({
    definition(t) {
      t.list.field('users', {
        type: 'User',
        resolve() {
-         return [{ id: '1643', name: 'newton' }]
+         return [{ id: 1643, name: 'newton' }]
        },
      })
    },
  })
```

So, as you can see, integrating Prisma is literally a matter of just using it. `pumpkins` will react to the presence of a `schema.prisma`, run Prisma generatings, setup photon, and setup `nexus-prisma`.

# Examples

### A minimal GraphQL API

```ts
// schema.ts

objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.name()
  },
})

queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.list.field('users', {
      type: 'User',
      resolve() {
        return [{ id: 1643, name: 'newton' }]
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```
$ pumpkins dev
```

### A GraphQL API backed by a Prisma data layer

```groovy
// schema.prisma

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:dev.db"
}

generator photon {
  provider = "photonjs"
}

model User {
  id   Int    @id
  name String
}

```

```ts
// schema.ts

objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.name()
  },
})

queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.list.field('users', {
      type: 'User',
      resolve() {
        return [{ id: 1643, name: 'newton' }]
      },
    })
  },
})
```

```
$ prisma2 dev
```

```
$ pumpkin dev
```

# Conventions

### Special File Names

```
                    Purpose                             Alt Names

app.ts              Entrypoint                          main.ts | server.ts | service.ts
context.ts          Define GraphQL resolver context
schema.ts           Define GraphQL types                graphql.ts
schema.prisma       Define Data Models
```

### `schema.ts`

Schema contains your GraphQL type definitions. It can be a single file or folder of files. There can also be multiple instances of file/folder throughout your source tree.

During development all files will be found and dynamically synchronously imported at app construction time. At build time static imports will be generated.

```
schema.ts | graphql.ts
```

```
schema/   | graphql/
  a.ts
  b.ts
  c.ts
```

### `context.ts`

Context contains the definition of the context object that will be made available to all your GraphQL resolvers. There can only be at most a single `context.ts` file in your source tree. If you do not provide one, a defualt will be, findable in `.pumpkins`.

```
context.ts
```

### `app.ts`

App contains the entrypoint to your service, the place where it boots. There can only be at most a single `app.ts` in your source tree. If you do not provide one, a default will be, findable in `.pumpkins`.

```
app.ts | main.ts | server.ts | service.ts
```

### Prisma Support

Prisma is seamlessly supported, yet optional. You automatically opt-in when you create the schema.prisma file somewhere in your project.

```
schema.prisma
```

The following things automatically happen once Prisma is enabled.

1. Pumpkins CLI workflows are extended:
   1. On build, Prisma generators are run
   2. During dev, Prisma generators are run after prisma schema file changes
2. The `nexus-prisma` Nexus plugin is automatically used. This you get access to `t.model` and `t.crud`.
3. An instance of the generated Photon.JS client is a added to context under `photon` property
4. The TypeScript types representing your Prisma models are registered as a Nexus data source. In short this enables proper typing of `parent` parameters in your resolves. They reflect the data of the correspondingly named Prisma model.

### Example Layouts

Nano

```

    C/
      context.ts

# Development

### Overview

```
yarn
yarn test
yarn dev
```

### Testing

Integration tests rely on `npm link`. This means those integration tests cannot
work on a machine that has not done `npm link` inside the root of the cloned
repo.

The reason we do not use `yarn link` is that yarn [does not symlink the bin into
local node_modules](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5713).
